# Xphoot App


## Background

Once upon a time, three backend-developers that where awed by the enjoyment of http://kahoot.it asked their self how difficult it would be to create a (suspiciously) similar app using Enonic XP. They wondered if the powers of http://repo.enonic.com/public/com/enonic/xp/docs/6.5.2/docs-6.5.2-libdoc.zip!/module-lib_xp_websocket.html, their bare hands and meagre front-end skills would be enough to overcome this beast.
